Recently I was practicing competitive programming on [UVa's online judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/). I was doing question 1625 (context does not matter), and got TLE for a few submissions. For those that are unfamiliar, TLE is time limit error, where the program you wrote spent longer to solve the problem than the designated time. Searching online, there were few solutions. I restructured the code, but still got an error. After further digging, I found this [post](https://blog.csdn.net/wu_tongtong/article/details/78404494), which details TLE for the same problem as well. It appears `memset` is the error! I was using `memset` to clear 2 arrays of ints with size 5000 * 5000 for each test case (total of 50 million ints, equating 200 million bytes). At the time, I did not consider the size of the memory required to clear. Anyway, after removing the `memset`, the program ran fine.

Though now I may seem crazy to believe reseting 200MB of RAM takes insignificant time, it is what I thought at that time. Software engineering classes taught me to initialise your variables, even if they will be overwritten soon. Though most copmpetitive programming guides recommend using `memset` to clear arrays, I guess you really need to consider which arrays are necessary to clear. For those used for DP, clearly they are not required.
