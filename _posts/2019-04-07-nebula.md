## Introduction

As the challenges are relatively short, I will be slowly updating this post will the ones I have completed. The VM can be obtained at [Exploit Education](https://exploit.education/nebula/), a website created by Andrew Griffiths that teaches common (and less than common) weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Linux.

The main purpose of each level is to escalate privileges from the normal 'levelxx' account to the 'flagxx' account, and then execute `getflag`.  

## Level00

This is a trivial question that requires some understanding of `find`. In this particular scenario, `man` pages did not help a lot, as it was flooded with options and configurations. After some reading, the following solution was obtained.

```
find . -executable -type f -user "flag00" 2>/dev/null
```

The outputted files are then ran, which logs into the 'flag00' account, and `getflag` provides the flag.
